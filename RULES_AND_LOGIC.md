# 📜 TaleSpin: The Rules of the Multiverse

To prevent chaos and ensure high-quality storytelling, TaleSpin operates on a strict set of logic, constraints, and roles.

---

## 👑 1. The "Canon" System (Visibility Logic)

With infinite branches, how do users know what to read?

*   **The Canon Path (Gold Line):** The specific sequence of nodes with the **Highest Cumulative Votes**. This is the "Official" story shown by default.
*   **The Coup D'état:** If an alternative branch gets *more* votes than the current Canon node, it **overtakes** it instantly. The old path becomes a "Legend" (thin grey line).
    *   *Addictive Hook:* Users campaign to make *their* version the official one.
*   **Withering:** If a branch receives **0 votes** in 24 hours, it fades out (becomes hidden/archived) to keep the tree clean.

---

## 🚧 2. Constraints (Anti-Spam & Quality)

*   **The One-Step Rule:** A user cannot reply to their own node immediately. You must wait for someone else to continue the story before you can jump back in. (Forces collaboration).
*   **Token Limits:**
    *   **Minimum:** 50 characters (No low-effort "Lol" or "Next").
    *   **Maximum:** 280 characters (Fast, punchy, Twitter-style) OR 1 image/GIF.
*   **Cooldown:** A user can create max **3 New Branches** (divergences) per hour, but can write infinite **Continuations** (linear additions).

## 📸 3. Media Types

A Checkpoint is not just text. It creates a vibe.

*   **Text:** The standard narrative.
*   **AI Voice:** Writer selects a "Voice Skin" (e.g., 'Horror Whisper', 'Anime Narrator'). The app plays the text.
*   **Visual:** A reaction GIF, an uploaded sketch, or an AI-generated scene.
*   **The Choice Node:** A special node that forces a split.
    *   *Text:* "He saw two pills."
    *   *Interaction:* User must click [Red Pill] or [Blue Pill] button to reveal the hidden branches below.

---

## 👥 4. Community & Privacy

*   **Public (The Arena):** Open to everyone. Ranked on the Global Feed.
*   **Circles (Squads):** Private stories invite-only. (e.g., "The Goa Trip Story").
    *   *Feature:* Admin can "Publish" a private story to the global feed once it's finished.
*   **Anonymous Mode:** Post a branch as "Unknown Drifter". Good for horror/confessions. Karma still tracks to the main profile silently.

---

## 🔘 5. Interaction Design (UI Buttons)

**Reader Actions:**
*   **Swipe Horizontal:** Switch timelines at a junction point.
*   **Peek (Long Press):** Preview the next 3 nodes of a branch without switching to it.

**Writer Actions:**
*   **⬇️ Continue:** Add a node linearly (if no branch exists).
*   **🌱 Branch Here:** Create a divergence from the current moment.
*   **⚔️ Challenge:** Explicitly mark your branch as a "Better Version" of an existing node (triggers a Vote Battle).

## 🏅 6. Roles & Status

*   **👻 Ghost:** Read-only user.
*   **🖋️ Scribe:** Contributor (>10 accepted nodes).
*   **🕸️ Weaver:** Created a branch that became Canon (>500 votes).
*   **👑 God Mode (Genesis Author):** The creator of the story.
    *   *Power:* Can "Pin" a favorite branch as "Author's Choice" (even if it loses the popular vote).
