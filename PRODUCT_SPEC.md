# 📚 TaleSpin: The Multiverse Story Engine

**"Don't just read a story. Build its future."**

TaleSpin is a collaborative storytelling platform where every story splits into infinite parallel universes, written by the community. It combines the creativity of Wattpad with the branching logic of Git.

## 💡 The Core Concept

Unlike linear platforms (Reddit, Twitter), TaleSpin treats stories as **Trees (Graphs)**.
*   **Genesis Node:** The starting point (e.g., "The billionaire spilled soup on his boss.").
*   **The Branching:** Users don't just comment; they **continue** the story.
    *   *Path A:* "He apologized."
    *   *Path B:* "He bought the company."
*   **The Multiverse:** Multiple versions of the story exist simultaneously. Readers choose which timeline to follow.

## ⚙️ Mechanics & Rules

### 1. The Checkpoint System
*   **Constraint:** Users write in small chunks (Checkpoints). Max **280 characters** or **1 Paragraph**.
*   **Immutability:** Once a node is posted, it cannot be edited, only branched from.

### 2. Branching Logic
*   At any checkpoint, a user can:
    *   **Vote:** Support an existing continuation (making it "Canon").
    *   **Branch:** Write a *new* continuation (creating a divergent timeline).
*   **The Canon Lock:** The branch with the most votes becomes the "Main Timeline" (visually thicker line), but "Alternative Timelines" are always accessible.

### 3. Gamification
*   **Canon Points:** Earn points when users vote for your branch.
*   **Badges:**
    *   🏗️ **The Architect:** Started a story with 100+ branches.
    *   🌪️ **The Twister:** Wrote a plot twist that changed the canon path.
    *   🏁 **The Closer:** Wrote a highly-voted ending.

## 📱 UI/UX Vision

*   **Tree View:** A visual graph showing the story's evolution.
    *   *Thick Line:* The popular path.
    *   *Thin Lines:* Niche/Experimental paths.
*   **Swipe Navigation:** At a junction point, swipe Left/Right to explore different outcomes ("Dark Timeline" vs "Happy Timeline").
*   **Read Mode:** Seamless scrolling of the selected path (hides the complexity).

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture (The Data Engineering Flex)

This is not just a CRUD app. It is a **Graph Traversal Problem**.

### 1. Data Model (Graph DB)
Ideally powered by **Neo4j** or **PostgreSQL (Recursive CTEs)**.

**Nodes (The Content):**
```json
{
  "id": "node_123",
  "content": "He realized the waiter was his father.",
  "author_id": "user_99",
  "parent_id": "node_122",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-18T10:00:00Z",
  "tags": ["plot_twist", "emotional"]
}
```

**Edges (The Relationship):**
```json
{
  "from": "node_122",
  "to": "node_123",
  "votes": 5420,
  "type": "continuation"
}
```

### 2. Backend Stack
*   **Language:** Go (Golang) for high-concurrency tree traversal.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (with `ltree` or recursive queries) + Redis (for hot "Canon" caching).
*   **API:** GraphQL (Perfect for fetching nested story trees).

### 3. Frontend Stack
*   **Framework:** Flutter (Mobile + Web).
*   **Visualization:** Custom Tree Renderer (Canvas API) for the "Multiverse Map".

## 🚀 MVP Roadmap

1.  **Phase 1 (The Seed):** Users can post Genesis nodes and simple linear replies.
2.  **Phase 2 (The Split):** Enable branching. Multiple replies to the same parent.
3.  **Phase 3 (The Map):** Visual Tree interface to see all branches.
4.  **Phase 4 (The Vote):** "Canon" logic based on upvotes.
